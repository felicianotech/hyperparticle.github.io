## The Erasmus Mundus Program

I first heard of the Erasmus Mundus Master's program from a former alumnus, now a current professor at Boise State University. Basically, students in the program get the opportunity to study at two European partner universities, one year each, to obtain two Master's degrees at the end of it. I applied for the Language Communication Technologies (LCT) program in January 2017 and received an acceptance notice in April.

In addition, I received a scholarship which is essentially providing me a free education for my entire study period. I have more than enough funds for tuition, housing, living expenses, transportation, food, and basically anything else I need to live comfortably. It turns out living in Europe is cheap (aside from buying tech). Tuition, despite being double for overseas students (8,500 instead of 4,250), is completely covered. I'm grateful for this, as college expenses in the US is notoriously expensive, especially for Master's programs, which can reach as high as $40,000 for University costs alone. 

But many events have transpired since then.

Well, I've made it to the Czech Republic.

It took a couple days for the jet lag to wear off. A 7.5 hour flight is not a comfortable one.

On my third day in Prague I registered with the foreign police. The people I met with were highly unprofessional.

## Transportation in Prague

The transportation system around Prague is pretty great. The system of metro lines, trams, and busses ensure that you can get anywhere in the city in a short period of time. Tickets are quite cheap, and allow you to board any of the transportation in Prague. There's even a small boat that can take you from one side of the Vltava river to the other.

## Weather

Weather here is fairly calm and predictable. On most days, the sky will be overcast with clouds. Every few days it rains

I'm used to much drier, erratic weather back in Idaho. 

## Sights and Tours

Student discounts.

## Housing

Instead of going with the dorms, I've decided to stay at an apartment.

## Bureaucracy

Something tells me this process should have been easier, but it wasn't.
